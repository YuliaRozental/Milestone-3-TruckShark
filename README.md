# Truck Shark App

Application that locates local food trucks

# Description

Welcome to Truck Shark App. Truck Shark provides users access to food trucks in their area of choice. 
Food trucks load automatically as a user traverses to new zipcode within Google Maps. Users can order online, save their favorite trucks and review trucks.

Truck Shark App also allows food truck owners to create a business account and easily connect to current and potential customers. Owners can also update their location on the map via marker dragging and update their open/closed status instantly.
